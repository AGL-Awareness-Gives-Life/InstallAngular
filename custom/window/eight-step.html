                                            loader to ensure that the JavaScript code in the application is loaded correctly and executed in the right order. The Angular framework is delivered
                                            as a set of JavaScript modules, as are some of the required support libraries.

                                            All Angular projects have a root module that describes the application and can contain additional modules to group related features together and

                                        Data bindings are annotations in the template that tell Angular how to insert dynamic content, such as data values, and how to respond to user
