                    <h2>Download and Install using NPM </h2>
                    <p>After adding dependencies & packages in <strong>package.json</strong> file, run the <strong>"npm install"</strong> command </p>
                    <p> NPM will download the packages mentioned in <strong>package.json</strong> and install them in a folder <strong>"node_modules"</strong></p>
                    <h4>1. Why use NPM?</h4>  
                    <p>
                        It is the standard mechanism for managing JavaScript packages.
                        The world of JavaScript development has fragmented into an incredible number of small and focused packages that are woven together to create rich and fluid functionality.
                        Manually downloading the packages required for a project means working through a long list of dependencies, each of which has to be downloaded, installed, and inspected for its own dependencies.
                        Dependencies between packages can be specified loosely, allowing NPM some flexibility in the version it selects.
    
                    </p> 
                    <h4>2. Understanding the Dependencies Packages</h4>

                            <th>Discription</th>
                        </thead>

                                        <td>
                                            These packages provide the Angular functionality, which is split into separate modules. Each module provides a different set of features,
                                            and the modules are a good foundation for new web applications. I add other modules in later chapters to support specific
                                            features, such as working with HTML forms.

                                        This is the Reactive Extensions package, which is used to implement the Angular change-detection system that is used in data bindings,
                                        , and used directly for some Angular features.
